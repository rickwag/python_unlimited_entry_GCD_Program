# python_unlimited_entry_GCD_Program
This program calculates the greatest common divisor of any number of entries.
It gets the multiples of each of the numbers, puts them in a single list and checks for the common multiples.
Checking for the common multiples among all the multiples of all the numbers is critical for the functioning of the program.
So the common multiples are chosen if they appear as often as the entry numbers, which means that they exist in the multiples of every number.
The final step is just getting the largest of the common multiples.
